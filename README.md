# heatmap_app
Visualize gene expression data from human and mouse tissues from an [ENCODE data set](https://www.pnas.org/content/111/48/17224).

The shinyapp is deployed here https://yeredhp.shinyapps.io/heatmap_app/

For this comparison, I used the gene counts generated by `featureCounts` and an alternative annotation (Probes) taking into account the differences between the human and mouse gene annotations.
